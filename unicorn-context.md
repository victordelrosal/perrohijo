# Unicorn Context: Perrhijos

**Venture:** Perrhijos
**One-liner:** A premium, veterinary-led dog wellness membership brand in Colima, Mexico, built on the cultural insight that dogs are family members (perro-hijos) deserving pediatrician-level care.
**Stage:** Building (pre-launch, soft opening imminent)
**Last session:** 2026-02-21

## Notes

### What Perrhijos Is
Premium vet-led wellness brand in Colima metro. Two locations: La Casa Perrhijos (Comala, boutique flagship) and Centro Perrhijos (Villa de Alvarez, full-service hub). Founded by a licensed MVZ with an existing practice in Comala.

Membership tiers: Esencial $499/month, Familia $899/month (featured), Premium $1,499/month.
Year 1 target: 200 members, MXN $4-5M revenue. Breakeven Month 8-10.

### Session 1 Work (2026-02-21): Validation Research
Completed market research and business opportunity validation. Key findings:

**Market signals (all green):**
- Mexico #2 in world for pet-owning households
- USD 5.4B Mexico pet care market, 5-8% CAGR
- Spending up 45% since 2020; "perrhijo" in mainstream media
- Only 42% of dogs get preventive veterinary care (the gap Perrhijos fills)
- No premium membership vet brand exists in Colima or Jalisco (open market)
- Vetalia (Mexico City comparable) breaks even per clinic in 4 months, raised USD $10M
- Colima: 54.6% middle-class households, ranked #1 liveable small city in Mexico

**Validation gaps (still open):**
- No documented customer interviews in any project file; concept is desk-research based
- No confirmed founding member signups documented
- WTP at $899/month not validated with real conversations (behavioral change, not just a purchase)
- Two-location from day one is operationally complex before reaching 50 members

**Validation plan produced:** 5 experiments with success criteria and kill conditions.
- Experiment 1: Pre-sell to 30 warm contacts (MVZ's existing patients). Kill: fewer than 3 payment commitments.
- Experiment 2: 15 Mom Test interviews with non-patients. Kill: fewer than half describe fragmented care as a real pain.
- Experiment 3: Landing page ad conversion test (MXN 3-5K budget, Colima pet owners). Kill: under 3% click-through after one rewrite.
- Experiment 4: Price sensitivity embedded in interviews (3 tiers, no framing). Kill: 9 of 10 say $499 is "too expensive."
- Experiment 5: Concierge founding month (10 free month families, measure pay intent + referral).

**3 Prioritized next actions:**
1. Run the pre-sell now with existing patients via WhatsApp
2. Do 15 Mom Test interviews with non-patients (source from local Facebook pet groups)
3. Add a payment/deposit step to the founding member CTA on the landing page

### Landing Page Updates (2026-02-21)
Added market context stats strip (between brand story and life stages):
- Mexico #2 country for pet-owning households
- +45% spending growth since 2020
- 42% preventive care stat (the gap)

Added "El primer servicio de membresía de bienestar animal en Colima." first-mover line to founding members section.

### Open Questions
- Has the MVZ had informal conversations where someone said "I wish this existed in Colima"? (Strongest organic signal)
- Recommended next skill after validation experiments: unicorn-bizmodel (stress-test unit economics at both locations)
